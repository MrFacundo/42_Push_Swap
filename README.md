## Summary

Sorting algorythms and complexity. The goal of this project is to create a program that sorts a given list of random numbers with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

### How it works

The program takes a list of numbers as arguments and sorts them using two stacks and a limited set of instructions. The set of instructions includes rotating the stacks, swapping the top two numbers and pushing a number from one stack to the other. The program must print the instructions used to sort the list of numbers.

For example, if the program receives the list 3 2 1 4, it should print the following instructions:

	ra
	sa
	rra
### Checker (bonus assignment)

The repo also includes a checker program that checks if the list of numbers is sorted after the instructions are applied. The checker reads the instructions from the standard input and applies them to the list of numbers. If the list is sorted, the checker prints OK. Otherwise, it prints KO.
